# Fruits-Classifier
This project aims to aid the automation of fruit and vegetable harvesting, packaging and sale by developing a fruit and vegetable classification model that can accurately classify 65 kinds of fruits and vegetables. It uses CNN and ANN, built from scratch in Python, to classify them visually. It is trained on the Fruits 360 dataset from Kaggle.
